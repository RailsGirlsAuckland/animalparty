animalparty
===========

In your team, tell us a story about animals partying.

Each team has a branch for their story. Make sure you only put your story between the <code><--!start here--></code> and <code><--!end here--></code> tags.

Find GIFs to tell your story. 

When you're ready, use your new GitHub account to find your team's branch. Use the editor to add your GIF.

Click the story.md link, and click 'Edit'. Add your gif, and a few lines for the story. You'll need to use this format for the image:
<br>
<code>&#33;&#91;gif description&#93;&#40;http&#58;&#47;&#47;urlofyour&#46;gif&#41;</code>

Then, commit your changes. Add a message so we know what you're adding to the story.

You'll need to work with your team to make sure you don't have any merge conflicts. These happen when 2 members of a team try to add something to the story at the same time. You'll need to make sure your view of the story is up-to-date with the latest additions to your team's story before sending your commit.

If you get stuck, ask a coach for help.

When your team is done, your coach will merge your team branch back into the main branch, to make one mega-story.
